This project aims to create a unique 3D animated scene composed of WebGL graphic components, including animation, lighting effects, texture, frame 
buffers, 
and multiple objects.
Description: HTML/JavaScript using WebGL graphic components to create a unique 3D animation scene.
Animation: The scene has various animating objects in it. The sun revolves around the disk model and throws light in its direction. A car rotates around 
tent, building, and other things placed at the center. The sun shines in the daytime while the lamp turns off during the day and turns on at night. Some 
objects, such as the ring road, glow pink at night.
